                <p>We listen to music alone, with friends, with strangers. We discover new music, rediscover old music, stack collections on shelves and stream the global catalogue from the cloud. We book tickets, travel to venues, see our idols and buy their merch. We choose instruments, find teachers, read books, watch videos, take courses, study and practice. We compose, jam, audition, rehearse, find gigs, lug gear and chat with audiences. We make websites, record podcasts, send newsletters and post to social media. We record, mix, master and produce. We take videos and photographs. We book, promote and manage artists. We fiddle with gadgets and software and controllers. We accumulate cables, cases, spares and stands. We teach students old and new, from home, at schools and online. We enrich lives and create a better world.</p>
